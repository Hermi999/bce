    "## Context\n",
    "As more employees work from home, it is important to provide more options for them to securely access internal services and sites.\n",
    "These sites may be your intranet portal, sensitive HR or financial systems that are not exposed directly externally. Traditionally, companies accessed these sites after establishing a VPN tunnel from an employee’s laptop directly to the corporate network. Just about any administrator of such a system will tell you VPNs are expensive to procure, require a lot of resources, quite cumbersome to maintain and essentially provide security based on dynamically expanding the trusted network.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Google, we found the access model based primarily on a network perimeter did not sufficiently scale with a mobile workforce nor provide selective security guarantees for sensitive applications. Our approach was to assess the overall context of a given request for an application. By that we would take signals derived from multiple sources at runtime to evaluate the integrity of a call against the resource being accessed. For example, the evaluation signals for a request would include who is making the call, from what device, from what network, at what time, and so on. A request is not simply evaluated using an administrator defined static if-then chain, but also assigned trust levels based on heuristics inferred from prior contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The internal system Google used to achieve this is described in six BeyondCorp research papers which goes into more details about these signals. For our customers we make this same system available as __BeyondCorp (BCE).__\n",
